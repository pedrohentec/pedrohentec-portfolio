    summary: |
      I work in the development and monitoring of data pipelines in a GCP environment, focusing on performance, governance, and reliability of information. 
      I use Apache Beam and Dataflow for data orchestration in BigQuery, applying good modularization and asynchronous processing practices, reducing costs in a cloud environment and having a similar or improved impact.

      ● Creation of pipelines with Apache Beam (Python) in Dataflow, processing data in batches and streaming.

      ● Automatic validation of tables and partitions in BigQuery, with generation of dynamic models from JSON files.

      ● Monitoring of jobs via API (Dataflow and BigQuery), focusing on status, metrics, and data integrity.

      ● Data governance and classification with Dataplex, aligned with LGPD (Brazilian General Data Protection Law).

      ● Optimization and refactoring of legacy pipelines for greater efficiency and reusability.

    summary: |
      I worked as a Data Engineer on projects in an AWS environment, focusing on building and optimizing large-scale data pipelines. I worked on data ingestion, transformation, and delivery processes, directly contributing to the efficiency and governance of the solutions.

      ● Development of pipelines with Spark, SQL, and Python in an AWS EMR environment, orchestrated by Airflow.

      ● Optimization of queries and data flows using Athena, with data stored in S3, ensuring performance and cost-effectiveness.

      ● Use of Docker and Kubernetes (EKS) for packaging and deploying data applications.

      ● Support in implementing best practices for version control with Git/GitHub and code modularization for reuse and maintenance.

      ● Active participation in data requirements analysis, contributing technical insights to strategic decisions.
